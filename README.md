# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Candice

ðŸ’¡ *Curious about the â€˜whyâ€™ in healthcare | Using data to improve care, outcomes, and understanding.*

Iâ€™m a data analyst in training with a strong focus on healthcare.

I donâ€™t come from a traditional healthcare or analytics background, but Iâ€™ve always been interested in how things work and why they work. That naturally pulled me toward healthcare â€” because when you understand how systems impact people, especially in something as vital as health, you want to do better.

I believe data has the power to improve how we deliver care, how patients experience it, and how medical professionals make decisions.

My goal is to turn data into understanding so that care becomes more informed, systems work better, and patients feel seen.
